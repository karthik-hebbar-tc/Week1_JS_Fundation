Week 1 – Core JavaScript Foundations

During Week 1, I focused on building a strong foundation in JavaScript. The topics covered include:

Understanding variables (let, const) and scope

Working with primitive and reference data types

Using arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators

Writing conditional statements (if, else if, switch)

Implementing loops (for, while, do...while)

Creating and invoking functions (declarations, expressions, arrow functions)

Practicing basic algorithms and problem-solving
